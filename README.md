## 🧠 Who I Am  

Senior QA Engineer with **5+ years of experience** driving quality across Insurance, Logistics, HCM, and Microservices-based systems.

My focus is not just writing test cases — but building **automation ecosystems** that:

- 🚀 Improve release confidence  
- ⏱ Reduce regression effort  
- 🔁 Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD  
- 🧭 Enable shift-left testing  
- 📈 Support scalable product growth  

I collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and DevOps teams to ensure quality is **embedded throughout the SDLC — not added at the end.**
